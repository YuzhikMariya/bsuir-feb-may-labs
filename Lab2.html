					You can see a hedgehog sitting on the ground. The hedgehog belongs to the mammals of the subfamily Erinaceinae, in the eulipotyphlan family, Erinaceidae. It has small black ears, which are usually less than 3.5 cm. Its muzzle is elongated with a black nose that is sharp and constantly moist. The body weight is 700-800 g . On the upper jaw of the hedgehog we can’t see 20 small sharp teeth, and on the bottom there are 16 teeth but they are there. <br><br>Its head is relatively large, wedge-shaped, with a little lined face. It has 5 fingers with sharp claws on the paws. Its hind legs are longer than the front ones. The needles are about 2 cm. The needles are hollow inside, just filled with air. The needles grow with the same speed as the hair. Between the needles there are thin, long, very rare hair. The head and belly are covered with coarse and usually dark-colored hair. The hedgehog is an animal that is active at night time. It does not like to leave his house for a long time.  </p>

					The hedgehog spends its day in a nest or other shelter. Hedgehogs are quite fast for their size animals. They are able to run at speeds up to 3 m / s. They are also good at swimming and jumping. Like many nocturnal animals, the hedgehog has poorly eyesight, but they have a sharp sense of smell and hearing. When it becomes cold, European hedgehogs close the entrance to the burrow and fall into sleep. Usually such a hibernation lasts from October to April. <br><br>The hedgehog is an omnivore animal. The basis of its nutrition is insects, caterpillars, slugs, sometimes earthworms and even mice. Hedgehog can be a carrier of diseases such as dermatomycosis, yellow fever, salmonellosis, leptospirosis, rabies. They are found in large numbers of mites and fleas. Its needles are a good shelter for these microbes and bacteria that is difficult for hedgehogs to get rid of. In nature these animals live 3-5 years, in captivity they can live up to 8-10 years.
